Pegasus Simulator
#################

Overview
========

**Pegasus Simulator** is a framework built on top of `NVIDIA
Omniverse <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/>`__ and `Isaac
Sim <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html>`__. It is designed to provide an easy yet
powerful way of simulating the dynamics of multirotors vehicles. It provides a simulation interface for `PX4 <https://px4.io/>`__
integration as well as custom python control interface. At the moment, only multirotor vehicles are supported, with support for other vehicle topologies planned for future versions.

Latest Updates
==============

* **2024-08-02**: Pegasus Simulator v4.1.0 is released for Isaac 4.1.0. This version is **NOT** compatible with older versions of Isaac Sim.

Guidance, Control and Navigation Project
========================================

In parallel to this project, the Pegasus (GNC) guidance, control, and navigation project serves as the foundation control code for performing real-world experiments for my Ph.D. More information can be found at this link:
`Pegasus GNC <https://pegasusresearch.github.io/pegasus/>`__.

Developer Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This simulation framework is an open-source effort, started by me, Marcelo Jacinto in January/2023. It is a tool that was created with the original purpose of serving my Ph.D. workplan for the next 4 years, which means that you can expect this repository to be mantained, hopefully at least until 2027.
