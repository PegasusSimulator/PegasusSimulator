class Backend:
    """
    This class defines the templates for the communication and control backend. Every vehicle can have at least one backend
    at the same time. Every timestep, the methods 'update_state' and 'update_sensor' are called to update the data produced
    by the simulation, i.e. for every time step the backend will receive teh current state of the vehicle and its sensors. 
    Additionally, the backend must provide a method named 'input_reference' which will be used by the vehicle simulation
    to know the desired angular velocities to apply to the rotors of the vehicle. The method 'update' is called on every
    physics step and can be use to implement some logic or send data to another interface (such as PX4 through mavlink or ROS2).
    The methods 'start', 'stop' and 'reset' are callbacks that get called when the simulation is started, stoped and reset as the name implies.
