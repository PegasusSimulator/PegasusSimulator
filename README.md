**Pegasus Simulator** is a framework built on top of [NVIDIA
Omniverse](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/) and [Isaac
Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html). It is designed to provide an easy yet powerful way of simulating the dynamics of vehicles. It provides a simulation interface for [PX4](https://px4.io/) integration as well as a custom python control interface. At the moment, only multirotor vehicles are supported, with support for other vehicle topologies planned for future versions.

## Main Developer Team

This simulation framework is an open-source effort, started by me, Marcelo Jacinto in January/2023. It is a tool that was created with the original purpose of serving my Ph.D. workplan for the next 4 years, which means that you can expect this repository to be mantained, hopefully at least until 2027.
